Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

# The client was a gaming company named The Gaming Room who wanted to develop a new game called Draw It or Lose It. The game would allow multiple teams with multiple players in each team to compete against each other in guessing what a picture is as it is being rendered. They also wanted the server architecture designed as well. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 

# I feel that I did well in designing the UML diagram. I have had issues with understanding UML. I get the concepts in UML confused with each other too often and miss things. But this time I feel that I did a decent job on designing the UML diagram. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 

# It allowed me to see the problem in a step wise fashion. By breaking the problem down into smaller, bitesize and more manageable pieces, I was better able to understand the code. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

# I would reexamine the Development Requirements section. I felt that was my weakest place in the document. I would fix it by adding the things that I missed and adding more supporting material for the arguments and facts I was making. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

# I tried to imagine how the user would interact with the completed software and what they would want from the experience. This allowed me to better design the software to be easy to use and understand. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 

# I approached it one step at a time. I think that is the way I will approach all design and programming projects that I run across in my life. I get overwhelmed very easily by too much information so by taking all of it and breaking it down into steps will help me later in life.
